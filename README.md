# TFP2019-Academia

Code for TFP 2019 Academia Session for the Engineering Competency

## Mission

We are going to ramp up the engineering competency on all of the web Technologies that they need to know in order to make an awesome test application for learning the Angular framework. 

## Navigating the Repository

Navigate to the lessons branch and select the numbered lesson to access that week's materials related to the code and concepts covered in class.

Navigate to the features branch and select the feature of interest to learn about how it was developed and the process for creating the applciation.

Navigate to the master branch to view the finished application and all of the learning materials in one location.

## Learning Sessions

The format of the learning materials is still to be decided but the options up in the air now are:

1. Live Coding Videos
2. Sample annotated code with supplementary material
3. PowerPoints
4. IDEFK

## Application Sessions

The super cool reach goal that I think would be useful for those in the TFP cohort would be to create an application that actually worked and taught them how to use:

1. 3rd party APIs
2. The Angular Framework
3. Modern web technologies and methods

Some ideas for the application could be the following: 

1. [Hacker News Client](https://github.com/housseindjirdeh/angular2-hn)
2. [Image Retrieval App](https://unsplash.com/documentation#getting-started)
3. [Lunch Randomizer App](http://whatsforlunchshoreditch.com/)
4. [Book Recommendation App](https://www.goodreads.com/api)

There are so many possibilities beyond the simple todo app that has been done to death.
